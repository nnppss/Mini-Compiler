# MiniCompiler

## Overview  
MiniCompiler is a simplified compiler/interpreter in C++ built from scratch. It supports:  
- variable assignments  
- arithmetic & logical expressions  
- control flow (`if` / `else`, `while`)  
- printing statements  

Itâ€™s intended as an educational tool to understand building compilers: lexical analysis, parsing, AST construction, and interpretation.
