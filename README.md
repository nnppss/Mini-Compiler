# Mini-Compiler
Mini Compiler is a simplified interpreter designed to process and execute source code files containing basic programming constructs. It supports variable assignments, arithmetic and logical expressions, control flow statements (if-else and while loops), and print statements. This project serves as an educational tool to understand the fundamental components of a compiler, including lexical analysis, parsing, and interpretation.
